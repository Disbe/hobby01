Bingo01 is a standalone web simple game project made by one hundred old people named Martin, Jack.
This document was written using Dillinger a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor. see detail in [here](http://dillinger.io/).

      You can also:
        - become boring
	  - get the feeling you wanna crash any object around
	    - be to have a question why do I do this

	    Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

	    > The overriding design goal for Markdown's
	    > formatting syntax is to make it as readable
	    > as possible. The idea is that a
	    > Markdown-formatted document should be
	    > publishable as-is, as plain text, without
	    > looking like it's been marked up with tags
	    > or formatting instructions.

	    This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

	    ### Tech

	    Bingo01 wants use a number of open source projects to work properly:

	    * [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
	    * [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
	    * [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
	    * [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
	    * [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
	    * [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
	    * [Gulp] - the streaming build system
	    * [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
	    * [jQuery] - duh
	    * [phaser] - maybe this or PIXI
	    * [howler] - maybe or not

	    And of course Bingo01 itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
	     on GitHub.

	     ### Installation
